  <strong>COOKIES</strong>
  <p>
    To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use &quot;cookies&quot;, or similar electronic tools to

    Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer&#39;s connection to the Internet,

    identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site
    to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic
    locations from where our visitors come.
